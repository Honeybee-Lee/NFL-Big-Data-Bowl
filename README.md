# NFL-Big-Data-Bowl

#### Note that this is ongoing and the notebook is incomplete and will be updated in the future when the work is complete after the competition



Goal of the Competition:<br>

The National Football League (NFL) is back with another Big Data Bowl, where contestants use Next Gen Stats player tracking data to generate actionable, creative, and novel stats. Previous iterations have considered running backs, defensive backs, and special teams, and have generated metrics that have been used on television and by NFL teams. In this year’s competition, you’ll have more subtle performances to consider—and potentially more players to measure.<br>
    
2023 Theme: Linemen on Pass Plays<br>
    
Quarterbacks may get the glory, but some of the most important work takes place a few feet in front of them. The offensive line protects the passer, providing precious seconds to find receivers downfield. At the same time, the opposing team’s defensive line attempts to find a disruptive path. If a defender sneaks through, it can mean a sack, a blocked pass, or even a turnover. Some of the game’s most important plays happen on the line and this competition examines the data behind the hardest workers in football.<br>
In this competition, you’ll have access to the NFL’s Next Gen Stats data, including player tracking, play, game, and player information, as well as Pro Football Focus (PFF) scouting data for 2021 passing plays (Weeks 1-8 of the NFL season). You’ll create new metrics and stats for America's most popular sports league.
    Note: I have not uploaded the weekly data yet due to file size.
